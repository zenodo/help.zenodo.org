      <p>Once the DOI has been minted, it is not possible to change the files behind it. Doing so would be against a fundamental idea behind the DOI, which is the persistence of the content behind the DOI.

      <p>Google as well as other search engines index Zenodo pages periodically. We do not have control over how often Google is crawling our service, hence we cannot "force" the records to appear in Google/Google Scholar search results. Your record will eventually appear in Google, but we cannot determine when this will happen. To increase the visibility of your record, we recommend including its DOI and/or Zenodo URL to your homepage, as well as include those in your research profiles.</p>

In order to offer services to the more resource hungry research, we will introduce a ceiling to the free slice and offer paid for slices above, according to the business model developed within the sustainability plan.

      <p>Zenodo is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute) and takes an incentives approach to encourage depositing under an open license.

      <p>Since there isn't a unique way of licensing openly and nor a consensus on the practice of adding attribution restrictions, we accept data under a variety of licenses in order to be inclusive.
We will, however, take an active lead in signaling the extra benefits of the most open licenses, in terms of visibility and credit, and offer additional services and upload quotas on such data to encourage using them.
This follows naturally from the publications policy of the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE initiative</a>, which has been supporting Open Access throughout, but since it aims to gather all European Commission/European Research Area research results, it allows submission of material that is not yet Open Access.</p>

      <p>OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository got a make-over and was re-branded as Zenodo.
If you deposited your article in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, it is also available in Zenodo.
However, your user account was not transferred to Zenodo, so you will have to <a href="https://zenodo.org/signup/">register</a> again.
If you register with the same email address in Zenodo as you used in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, you will still have access to your publications.

      <p>Zenodo is still in its infancy, so whilst this is a good question to ask, we don’t have just one definitive answer since we are exploring several avenues as we mature our services.
Zenodo was launched within the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIREplus</a> project as part of a Europe-wide research infrastructure.
OpenAIREplus will deliver a sustainability plan for this infrastructure with an eye towards future Horizon 2020 projects and is thus one of our possible funding sources.
Another possible source of funding is CERN itself.
CERN hosts and develops several large services, such as <a href="http://cds.cern.ch">CERN Document Server</a> and <a href="http://inspirehep.net">INSPIRE-HEP</a>, which run the same software as Zenodo.
Additionally, CERN is familiar with preserving large research datasets because of managing the Large Hadron Collider data archive of 100 petabytes.
As you can see, our sustainability plan is still in development, but we are fully dedicated to delivering an open service and preserving your research for the future.</p>

      <p>Yes, your data is stored in CERN Data Center.
Both data files and metadata are kept in multiple online replicas and independent replicas.
CERN has considerable knowledge and experience in building and operating large scale digital repositories and a commitment to maintain this data centre to collect and store 100s of PBs of LHC data as it grows over the next 20 years.
In the highly unlikely event that Zenodo will have to close operations, we guarantee that we will migrate all content to other suitable repositories, and since all uploads have DOIs, all citations and links to Zenodo resources (such as your data) will not be affected.</p>
